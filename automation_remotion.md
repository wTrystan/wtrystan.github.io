## Summary

The goal of this project is to :
- Use my knowledge in coding in the field of music
- Create content on a daily basis for social media
- Learn how to use Remotion and how to automate actions

You can find below the differents steps to achieve this project.

## Step 1 : Scraping and computing of the informations

In order to make my program work, I needed to gather theses variables : 
 - The date of the day,
 - The title of the top 5 song of the day and the URI of their cover,
 - The URI of the cover from the Top 1 Artist

We will use the API of Spotify to collect these informations.
You can find the program [main.py](https://github.com/wTrystan/remotion_Tiktok_Spotify) here.

We need to compute some variables before sending it to Remotion.

- uriHexa : We will create a palette (Library colorThief, function getPalette) using the most dominant color of the cover artist (function getColor on the URI of the artist cover)
- colorTitle : We will determine if the color of the title is black (#000000) or white (#ffffff) depending on the color of the background determined in the variable above
- titleXX : Truncate the name of the title XX if longer than 29 characters

## Step 2 : Creation of the JSON file

Once we have all the functions to gather all the informations (the function LancerJSON(idPlaylist, texteSpotify, formatDate, fichier)), they will store it into a JSON file.

ex : lancerJSON('37i9dQZEVXbLRQDuF5jeBp', "Today's Spotify Top 5", "%m-%d-%Y", 'propsUSA.json')

- The first variable tells the program to scrap data from the [Top 50 - USA](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZEVXbLRQDuF5jeBp) with the URI given
- The second variable is the title given for this video 
- The third variable is the format given for the date displayed in the video
- The fourth variable is the name of the output for the JSON created

Thanks to these function, I can easily modify the informations to have the same in French !

lancerJSON('37i9dQZEVXbIPWwFssbupI', "Top 5 Spotify du ", "%d/%m/%Y", 'propsFR.json')

Here is an overview of the JSON file :

<code class="language-json">{"titleText": "Today's Spotify Top 5","dateToday": "04-14-2024",
"artist_URI": "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6761610000e5ebad85a585103dfc2f3439119a","colorTitle": "#ffffff",
"hexa_background": "#391c2c,#915d9b,#988878",
"urlTop1": "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2732e8b4358d044b75807e30bf0",
"urlTop2": "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273a46b07c291e6dfdee13b3ee8",
"urlTop3": "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273e67611dbbf69a90d0b6cb738",
"urlTop4": "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2730a31b4026a452ae8c3f97a76",
"urlTop5": "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273cc04ff3e70e146ba9abacf40",
"title1": "Hozier - Too Sweet","title2": "Future - Like That","title3": "Artemas - i like the way you ...","title4": "Â¥$ - CARNIVAL","title5": "Benson Boone - Beautiful Thin..."}</code>

## Step 3 : Tuning of the Remotion program

We are now going to create the template to create the video with React, using Remotion.

<img src="interface_Remotion.PNG">

This is the user interface, but all of the work is located in the .TSX file
Here is a snippet of code for the cover :

<code>export const MainCover: React.FC<{
	scale: number;
    source: string;
    topValue: number;
}> = ({scale, source, topValue}) => {
	const config = useVideoConfig();
	const frame = useCurrentFrame();
	const opacity = interpolate(frame, [0, 25], [0, 1]);
	return (
 <Img src={source} style={{
				position: 'absolute',
				marginTop: topValue,
				marginLeft: 80,
				width: '18%',
				opacity,
				borderRadius: 50,
			}}/>
	);
};</code>

Once the template is done, we will include the values available in the JSON file to personnalise the video.

<Video src=formatUSA.mp4>

All of the differents .TSX files are available [here](https://github.com/wTrystan/remotion_Tiktok_Spotify) 

## Step 4 : Post on Social Media 

## Step 5 : Automation of the steps on local machine

## (BONUS) : Automation on AWS
